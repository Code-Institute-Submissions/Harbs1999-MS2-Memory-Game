# Milestone Project Three: Greatreads

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories:
*  Users:
1. I would like to play a game that I can enjoy.
2. I would like to be able to see my score.
3. I would like to see my time to see how fast I can finish the game.
4. I would like the game to function properly.
5. I would like clear indications as to what is happening.
*  Creator:
1. As the creator of this site I would like to play my own game.
2. The same as the user's stories.
### Design:
* Color:
For this site I kept the theme simple to create more focus on the game itself.
*  Imagery:
The theme of the game was Marvel so the card backs are Marvel and all of the card fronts are Marvel characters that the user must match.

## Deployment
This project was developed in the gitpod IDE and pushed to a repository on GitHub
The following is how I deployed my project.
1. Log into GitHub
2. From the list of repositories, click "Harbs1999/MS2-Memory-Game".
3. Click on settings out of the tabs above.
4. Navigate to "pages" tab on left.
5. On the dropdown menu labelled "none", choose "master" branch.
6. Now refresh and it should say if your site has been published in green.

## Technologies Used
### Languages Used:
*  HTML5
*  CSS3
*  JavaScript
### Libraries, Frameworks and Programs:
*  Jquery
*  Bootstrap
*  Github
*  Gitpod
*  Balsamiq Wireframes
## Testing
*  Used Chrome dev tools to check the console for errors to fix.
*  Used Chrome dev tools to fix CSS problems.
*  Had somebody else play the game to get feedback.
*  Tested buttons and events in all devices by using Chrome dev tools.
## Bugs that Need Fixing
*  The biggest bug that needs fixing is the ability to double press a single card and it counting as a point. I will figure out how to fix this bug in the future by asking peers and searching through Stack Overflow and other forums.
*  Another bug that needs fixing is the timer goes down another second before finishing. This results in the user getting a second less on their time which could be frustrating. I will do this by refactoring my code and checking Stack Overflow as it is where I got my inspiration for the timer.
